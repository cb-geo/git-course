# Git

Git is a distributed version control system. Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. Use a version control system to store your documents, files and codes as repositories on online git hosting sites such as [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), [GitHub](https://education.github.com/) or  [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/software/views/bitbucket-academic-license.jsp).

The CB-Geo maintains a [git server](https://github.com/cb-geo) for software developed within the research group.
