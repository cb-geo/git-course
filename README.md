## Overview

This site includes a collection of modules that attempt to cover the basics of
the version control system `git`. Each module is a self-contained lesson on a
particular topic. This site does not attempt to be exhaustive in its content,
however in my experience the content presented covers about 90% of the
situations you are likely to encounter. After completing these modules and
learning the command-line syntax you can expect to be able to use `git` in your
projects with intermediate proficiency.

All the best,

## How to Use this Site

The site is composed of modules on various topics. Each module is self-contained
and intended as tutorial, meaning it is important to follow along with the
examples on your local machine to ensure you are understanding the
material and to start building your command line proficiency.

If you have never used `git` before, begin by reviewing the modules in order
starting with [Getting Started](intro/getting_started.md) and ending with
[Fixing Common Mistakes](intro/fixing_common_mistakes.md). These modules will
provide you a solid foundation to understand the concepts behind version control
and the `git` syntax.

If you have used `git` before in the past or after you have completed the
introductory modules and are looking for more information
skip ahead to the modules you find the most interesting or the most useful,
there is no need to complete these additional topics in any particular order.

Finally, if you do not see any information on a topic that is of interest to
you, feel free to request it.
